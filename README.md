Module 21 Challenge

## Overview of the Analysis

The pupose of this analysis is to build and optimize a deep leaning model to prdict the success of charity funding applications. Using machine learning and neural netowrkd, this challenge amis to decelop a binary classifer that predict whether funding apprication will be successful or not, with a goal of achieving a predictive accuracey of 75% or higher.



## Results
- Data Preprocessing
- Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

## Summary

Despite several optimization attempts, the model did not achieve the target performance of 75% accuracy. Future efforts could involve exploring other models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Support Vector Machines, which may be better suited for this classification problem.
